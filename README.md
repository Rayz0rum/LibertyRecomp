> This recompilation is in early development and is NOT meant for public use. This is a work-in-progress fork based on the MarathonRecomp framework.

Liberty Recompiled is an unofficial port of the Xbox 360 version of Grand Theft Auto IV created through the process of static recompilation. The port supports **Windows, Linux, macOS, iOS, Android, PlayStation 4, and Nintendo Switch**.

**This project does not include any game assets. You must provide the files from your own legally acquired copy of the game to install or build Liberty Recompiled.**

The runtime is powered by a fork of the [ReXGlue SDK](https://github.com/rexglue/rexglue-sdk) ([our fork](https://github.com/OZORDI/LibertyRecomp/tree/beta/glue)), which handles PowerPC → C++ recompilation and Xenos shader translation. The development of static recompilation tooling in this space was directly inspired by [N64: Recompiled](https://github.com/N64Recomp/N64Recomp), which was used to create [Zelda 64: Recompiled](https://github.com/Zelda64Recomp/Zelda64Recomp).

## Project Status

This project is in **early development**. Current progress:

### Completed
- [x] ReXGlue SDK integration for PowerPC → C++ translation and shader conversion
- [x] Cross-platform build system (Windows, Linux, macOS, iOS, Android, PS4, Switch)
- [x] Installer wizard with ISO/folder/XContent support
- [x] Shader extraction pipeline (RAGE FXC → Xbox 360 → platform-native)
- [x] Platform-specific install directory support
- [x] FusionFix-compatible mod overlay system

### In Progress
- [ ] RAGE engine structure reverse engineering
- [ ] GPU/rendering pipeline implementation
- [ ] Game-specific patches and fixes

### Completed (Previously TODO)
- [x] Audio system implementation (XMA decoder, SDL2 driver)
- [x] Save data handling (full save system with GTA IV format support)
- [x] Input remapping for GTA IV controls (SDL HID driver, GTA4 input patches)
- [x] Network/multiplayer stubs (NetDll_XNetStartup, XLive stubs)
- [x] Online multiplayer via GameNetworkingSockets (P2P with NAT traversal, no VPN required)
- [x] File system and RPF archive handling (VFS)

## Installation

### Platform Install Directories

| Platform | Install Directory |
|----------|-------------------|
| Windows | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\LibertyRecomp\` |
| Linux | `~/.local/share/LibertyRecomp/` |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/LibertyRecomp/` |
| iOS | `<Documents>/LibertyRecomp/saves/` |
| Android | Internal storage (first boot extraction) |
| PS4 | Internal storage via OpenOrbis VFS |
| Switch | `sdmc:/LibertyRecomp/saves/` |

### Game Files Required

You need a legal copy of GTA IV for Xbox 360. Supported formats:
- Xbox 360 disc images (`.iso`)
- Extracted game folders
- XContent packages

See [Dumping Guide](/docs/DUMPING-en.md) for detailed extraction instructions.

### Launch Arguments

| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `--install` | Force reinstallation (useful if game files were modified) |
| `--install-dlc` | Force DLC installation only |
| `--install-check` | Verify file integrity |

## Mod Support

Liberty Recompiled includes **FusionFix-compatible mod loading**. Mods can override game files by placing them in overlay folders.

### Quick Start

1. Create an `update/` folder next to the LibertyRecomp executable
2. Place mod files inside, mirroring the game's folder structure
3. Launch the game - mod files automatically override base files

```
LibertyRecomp/
├── game/           # Extracted game files
└── update/         # Place mods here
    └── common/
        └── data/
            └── handling.dat  # Overrides base handling.dat
```

### Supported Overlay Locations

| Priority | Location | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| 100 | `mods/update/` | Highest priority |
| 50 | `update/` | Standard FusionFix location |
| 40 | `GTAIV.EFLC.FusionFix/update/` | Alternative location |

See [MOD_SUPPORT.md](/docs/MOD_SUPPORT.md) for detailed documentation.

## Building

[Check out the building instructions here](/docs/BUILDING.md).

### Quick Start

```bash
# Clone with submodules
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/OZORDI/LibertyRecomp.git
cd LibertyRecomp

# Add game files to LibertyRecompLib/private/
# - default.xex
# - xbox360.rpf

# Configure and build (select your platform preset)
cmake . --preset macos-release      # macOS
cmake . --preset windows-release    # Windows
cmake . --preset linux-release      # Linux
cmake . --preset ios-debug          # iOS (requires Xcode)
cmake . --preset android-release    # Android
cmake . --preset ps4-release        # PS4 (requires OpenOrbis)
cmake . --preset switch-release     # Switch (requires devkitPro)

cmake --build ./out/build/<preset> --target LibertyRecomp
```
